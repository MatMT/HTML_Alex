        <p>The computer is a device that has the ability to execute a series of operations
        through a program so that input information processing can be
        performed and when returned to the user it is useful.</p>

           <p>The creation of the computer starts after the failure of Charles Babbage, his idea
           was re-concieved at the end of the 19th century at the USA arrived a massive waves 
           of inmmigrants terrified of carrying the 1980 census count but the solution of that 
           comes from a former MID Inspector called Hermans Hollerith that introduced a number
           of machines would make the census count very easy and in a short time called

           was winning terrytory using their computer called <a href=https://bletchleypark.org.uk/our-story/the-challenge/enigma><b>The Enigma</b></a> and it was created by Arthur Sherbius in 1923.
           
           But there is a person that deciphered the German Messages and broke the Enigma code and his name is 
           <a href=https://www.biography.com/scientist/alan-turing>Alan Turing</a> 
           a British Mathematican.</p>

    <p>After the War The creation of computers continues but for a single use and which only the government or scientists had access to. 
        That totally changed in the middle of the 70s when Steve Jobs and Steve Woznisak began manufacturing a 
        small computer in a garage in Palo Alto, California the Fist Personal Computers and the first to combine 
        a connected microprocessor for a keyboard and monitor called <a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/475761/apple-1-launch/">Apple I</a></p>

    <p>After that they created a company called <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/history-of-apple-steve-jobs-mac-3606104/">Apple</a>. 
        It must be taken into account that the pc in those years were with a very high price, but it was not long that 
        this miracle came to people at a very low price, that's why Apple created <a href=https://www.mac-history.net/featured-2/2021-02-10/the-history-of-the-apple-macintosh>The Macintosh</a> 
        in 1984.</p>
