    <p>Tools to build a computer
    Regarding the work area, we must have not only the cabinet and the different internal components that will make up the new PC, but we must also have the following elements available:</p>
  <div id="lista">
    <ul type="disc"> 
                            <li>Screwdrivers of various steps and sizes.</li>
                            <li>Some extra screws.</li>
                            <li>Cleaning Cloth.</li>
                            <li>Isopropyl alcohol to clean.</li>
                            <li>A small long nose pliers.</li>
                            <li>A flashlight (optional).</li>
                        </ul> 
                    </div>
                    &nbsp;
    <p>Before beginning assembly, it is recommended to clean the components and the various surfaces of the cabinet with the cloth and isopropyl alcohol to remove any accumulated dirt and dust.</p>
    
    <p>First thing you’ll want to do is strip the case down as far as you can go. Remove every panel that you can, and store them in a safe place 
    (inside the case box is the best bet). We recommend using a bowl (or a magnetic parts tray if you want to be fancy) to hold your screws 
    throughout your PC building process.</p>

   <p>If you’ve purchased some replacement or extra cooling fans, now is the time to install them where you need them. Try to keep your cooling setup balanced,
     so there’s as much air being drawn in, as is being blown out. In case you’re not sure which way the wind will go, the plastic fan guards usually denotes where the air will come through.
    Typically you want two fans in the front drawing air in and at least one in the rear blowing air out. You could also screw one or two more 
    optional fans into the roof of the PC case for additional exhaust, if your PC case has mounting points for them.</p>

    <h1><b>Motherboard Installation</b></h1></font>

    <p>Before we get to install the motherboard, you’ll want to check on a few things about your PC case. Check for pre-installed motherboard standoffs, ensure the number and arrangement of them conforms to the holes found on your motherboard. </p>
    <p>Secondly, see if your PC case has a  large CPU cutout or window cut into the back of the motherboard frame. If it doesn’t you may want to install any CPU cooler backplates and M.2 solid-state drives at this juncture.</p>
    <p>Now that’s done, first find your motherboard’s rear I/O shield, and push it into the rectangular slot in the back of your PC case. Make sure it’s right side up by matching the pattern of cutouts to the arrangement of ports on the back of your motherboard. </p>
    <p>Next, lay your motherboard down inside the chassis – carefully lining up its rear ports with the corresponding holes in the I/O shield you just installed – on top of the standoffs installed in your chassis.</p>
    <p>Then it’s a simply case of securing the motherboard down with the screws that came with your chassis. Make sure you use the right ones here, as you don’t want to thread the standoffs, in case you need to remove it at a later date.</p>

        <h1><b>CPU Installation</b></h1></font>
    <p>Next up, socket your CPU into the motherboard. Here’s where things are a little different depending on which processor family and/or brand you decided to go with.</p>
    <p>For Intel mainstream CPUs, slide the spring loaded retention arm out and up, then lift the bracket up leaving the plastic cover in place. 
        Then, gently place your CPU inside the socket, matching the golden triangle located on the bottom left corner of the processor, with the triangle on the socket bracket. </p>
    <p>For the next step, you should slide the securing bracket back into its original position so it locks in place underneath the screw, and secure the retention arm back down. During this process the protective plastic cover should pop off, so don't freak out if it comes flying at you. Be sure to stow the cover away in a safe place as it'll protect the motherboard's sensitive pins if you decide to remove the processor from the motherboard. </p>
