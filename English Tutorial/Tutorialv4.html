    <p>Tools to build a computer
    Regarding the work area, we must have not only the cabinet and the different internal components that will make up the new PC, but we must also have the following elements available:</p>
  <div id="lista">
    <ul type="disc"> 
                            <li>Screwdrivers of various steps and sizes.</li>
                            <li>Some extra screws.</li>
                            <li>Cleaning Cloth.</li>
                            <li>Isopropyl alcohol to clean.</li>
                            <li>A small long nose pliers.</li>
                            <li>A flashlight (optional).</li>
                        </ul> 
                    </div>
    <p>Before beginning assembly, it is recommended to clean the components and the various surfaces of the cabinet with the cloth and isopropyl alcohol to remove any accumulated dirt and dust.</p>
    
    <p>First thing you’ll want to do is strip the case down as far as you can go. Remove every panel that you can, and store them in a safe place 
    (inside the case box is the best bet). We recommend using a bowl (or a magnetic parts tray if you want to be fancy) to hold your screws 
    throughout your PC building process.</p>

   <p>If you’ve purchased some replacement or extra cooling fans, now is the time to install them where you need them. Try to keep your cooling setup balanced,
     so there’s as much air being drawn in, as is being blown out. In case you’re not sure which way the wind will go, the plastic fan guards usually denotes where the air will come through.
    Typically you want two fans in the front drawing air in and at least one in the rear blowing air out. You could also screw one or two more 
    optional fans into the roof of the PC case for additional exhaust, if your PC case has mounting points for them.</p>
