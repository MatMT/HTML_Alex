            through a program so that input information processing can be
            performed and when returned to the user it is useful.

           But there is a person that deciphered the German Messages and broke the Enigma code and his name is

    <p>After the War The creation of computers continues but for a single use and which only the government or scientists had access to. 
        That totally changed in the middle of the 70s when Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak began manufacturing a 
        small computer in a garage in Palo Alto, California the Fist Personal Computers and the first to combine 
        a connected microprocessor for a keyboard and monitor called <a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/475761/apple-1-launch/" target="_blank"><font color="#d82c68"><b>Apple I</font></b></a></p></td>

   <p>After that they created a company called <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/history-of-apple-steve-jobs-mac-3606104/" target="_blank"><font color="#d82c68"><b>Apple</b></a></font>
        It must be taken into account that the pc in those years were with a very high price, but it was not long that 
        this miracle came to people at a very low price, that's why Apple created <a href=https://www.mac-history.net/featured-2/2021-02-10/the-history-of-the-apple-macintosh target="_blank"><font color="#d82c68"><b>The Macintosh</b></a></font>
        in 1984. What made the Macintosh very easy to use was because of its operating system and very cheap to buy it This is currently one of the most famous computers and also for owning <a href="https://www.siliconvalleyhistorical.org/intel-history" target="_blank"><font color="#d82c68"><b>Intel</a></font></b> Core i3, i5 i7 and Intel
        Xeon processors. MacBook, iMac, MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, Mac Mini, etc. were created
        from the MAC name.</p>
